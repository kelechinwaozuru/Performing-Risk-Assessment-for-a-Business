**Reviewing the following scenario.**
You’ve joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank’s current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks in relation to the bank funds.
A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization’s assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment. Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.
		**SOLUTION**
Considering the following risks in relation to the assets (funds) i would score based on their likelihood, severity, and Priority.
Business email compromise
Compromised user database
Financial records leak
Theft
Supply chain attack
	**Things to consider when evaluating the likelihood of the risk to determine the potential frequency of the risk occurring:**
Could the risk happen once a day?
Could the risk happen once a month?
Could the risk happen once in a year?
**Things to consider when evaluating the Severity of the risk to determine the potential consequence of the risk occurring:**
How would the business be affected?
What’s the financial harm to the business and its customers?
Can important operations or services be impacted?
Are there regulations that can be violated?
What is the reputational damage to the company’s standing?
The image below shows the risk register solution to this scenario.
